# Introduction

Over the years, machine learning algorithms have become a more important part of our lives.
We are surrounded by machine learning algorithms, from the rise of large language models (LLMs) 
like ChatGPT over the years to machine learning algorithms recommending videos to users on 
streaming sites. One of these machine learning algorithms or models is known as generative 
artificial intelligence (AI). Some examples include ChatGPT which can generate explanations and 
explain concepts in a manner that the user specified. Moreover, there are generative AI such as 
Stable Diffusion which can generate images from a text prompt. @fig-cityscape shows an image 
generated using Stable Diffusion which depicts a post-apocalyptic cityscape as an example prompt.

Contrary to generative AI, there is discriminative AI which can decide on the decision boundary between different outputs. They essentially take existing data and learn where to draw the lines such that new information can be put in the proper section. However, generative AI instead learns the actual distribution of the data so that it can generate the data the model learned. This means that they can generate new data that follows the same distribution as the original data which can also be used to classify new data.

# Details of Generative AI

As mentioned previously, generative AI can learn the distribution of the data and make future 
predictions based on that. They can also generate entirely new data as their output. Their 
ability to learn underlying distributions of data also allows them to model more complex 
relationships that are present in real data. @fig-gen-vs-discrim below shows an image that 
depicts the difference between generative and discriminative AI and how they learn the data.

![Comparison of how generative vs. discriminative models adapt to data [@gen_models]](gen_vs_disc_ai.jpg){#fig-gen-vs-discrim}

The top row shows generative AI learning the distribution and conforming closely to the data. 
However, a normal discriminative model is not able to capture the unique stretched nature of the 
data and there are some overlaps which can be seen in the bottom row. Their ability to better 
capture the underlying distribution can allow them to be more accurate when trying to model data 
that is difficult to separate normally. Moreover, they can even generate new data based on the 
original data they were trained on. For example, @fig-mnist shows generated images of the MNIST 
digit recognition dataset. Generative models such as Na√Øve Bayes are also used regularly to 
filter for spam in emails.

# Details of Discriminative AI

In contrast, discriminative AI learns the decision boundary for the data. They work by 
classifying data or making predictions by using the decision boundary they have learnt to sort 
between the different output classes. Discriminative models work by learning the differences 
between the various outcomes. For example, a discriminative model trying to predict whether an 
MRI scan of a brain contains a brain tumor or not might pick up on certain visual differences 
that do not exist in a tumor-free brain scan [@sharma2014brain]. They are also easier to train 
and can achieve high accuracy. This makes them useful in medical fields where their decisiveness 
and speed allow doctors to make faster diagnosis of critical conditions. @fig-decision-boundary shows an image with the decision boundary of a discriminative support vector machine (SVM) classifier on some randomply generated sample data.

```{python}
#| label: fig-decision-boundary
#| fig-cap: A discriminative model and its decision boundary between two classes
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Generate synthetic data
X, y = make_classification(
    n_samples=100,     # Number of samples
    n_features=2,      # Number of features (2D for visualization)
    n_informative=2,   # Number of informative features
    n_redundant=0,     # No redundant features
    n_clusters_per_class=1,
    class_sep=3.0,     # Separation between classes
    random_state=42
)

# Train an SVM classifier
clf = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=42)
clf.fit(X, y)

# Create a grid to plot decision boundary
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(X[:, 0].min()-1, X[:, 0].max()+1, 500),
                     np.linspace(X[:, 1].min()-1, X[:, 1].max()+1, 500))

# Predict on the grid
Z = clf.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)

# Plot the decision boundary
plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.8, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, edgecolor='k', cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
plt.title("Decision Boundary of SVM Classifier")
plt.xlabel("Feature 1")
plt.ylabel("Feature 2")
plt.show()
```

# Conclusion

As seen before, both types of models are suited to different tasks. Generative AIs are suited to 
generate new data, such as images and text and can be used to kick off creative ideas or for 
inspiration. They are better suited to model complex relationships that are present in real life 
data due to their ability to truly learn the underlying distribution and are therefore more 
suited for complex problems. On the other hand, discriminative AIs are faster to train on 
datasets, perform faster, and are more decisive. This makes them useful for quick predictions 
such as object and image detection in pictures and videos as well as in the medical field to 
detect brain tumors in MRI scans.

Overall, both of these types of AI models provide unique advantages for various tasks, and it is 
necessary to consider what the problem being asked is. These factors aid in picking the correct 
type of model to provide accurate results. Regardless, generative AI has become a large part of 
the modern technological ecosystem with the rise of ChatGPT and other LLMs. We are likely to 
continue to see these kinds of models evolve alongside discriminative models and being used more 
and more to handle complex tasks efficiently and effectively.
