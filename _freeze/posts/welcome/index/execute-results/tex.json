One of these machine learning algorithms or models is known as generative \nartificial intelligence (AI). Some examples include ChatGPT which can generate explanations and \nexplain concepts in a manner that the user specified. Moreover, there are generative AI such as \nStable Diffusion which can generate images from a text prompt. @fig-cityscape shows an image \ngenerated using Stable Diffusion which depicts a post-apocalyptic cityscape as an example prompt.\n\n![A post-apocalyptic cityscape, generated by the author](cityscape.png){#fig-cityscape}\n\nContrary to generative AI, there is discriminative AI which can decide on the decision boundary between different outputs. They essentially take existing data and learn where to draw the lines such that new information can be put in the proper section. However, generative AI instead learns the actual distribution of the data so that it can generate the data the model learned. This means that they can generate new data that follows the same distribution as the original data which can also be used to classify new data.\n\n# Details of Generative AI\n\nAs mentioned previously, generative AI can learn the distribution of the data and make future \npredictions based on that. They can also generate entirely new data as their output. Their \nability to learn underlying distributions of data also allows them to model more complex \nrelationships that are present in real data. @fig-gen-vs-discrim below shows an image that \ndepicts the difference between generative and discriminative AI and how they learn the data.\n\n![Comparison of how generative vs. discriminative models adapt to data [@gen_models]](gen_vs_disc_ai.jpg){#fig-gen-vs-discrim}\n\nThe top row shows generative AI learning the distribution and conforming closely to the data. \nHowever, a normal discriminative model is not able to capture the unique stretched nature of the \ndata and there are some overlaps which can be seen in the bottom row. Their ability to better \ncapture the underlying distribution can allow them to be more accurate when trying to model data \nthat is difficult to separate normally. Moreover, they can even generate new data based on the \noriginal data they were trained on. For example, @fig-mnist shows generated images of the MNIST \ndigit recognition dataset. Generative models such as Na√Øve Bayes are also used regularly to \nfilter for spam in emails.\n\n![Newly generated handwritten digits which are similar to MNIST dataset](gen_MNIST_digits.jpg){#fig-mnist}\n\n# Details of Discriminative AI\n\nIn contrast, discriminative AI learns the decision boundary for the data. They work by \nclassifying data or making predictions by using the decision boundary they have learnt to sort \nbetween the different output classes. Discriminative models work by learning the differences \nbetween the various outcomes. For example, a discriminative model trying to predict whether an \nMRI scan of a brain contains a brain tumor or not might pick up on certain visual differences \nthat do not exist in a tumor-free brain scan [@sharma2014brain]. They are also easier to train \nand can achieve high accuracy. This makes them useful in medical fields where their decisiveness \nand speed allow doctors to make faster diagnosis of critical conditions. @fig-decision-boundary shows an image with the decision boundary of a discriminative support vector machine (SVM) classifier on some randomply generated sample data.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/cell-2-output-1.pdf){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(Thumbnail photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@solenfeyissa?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Solen Feyissa</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-holding-a-cell-phone-in-their-hand-hWSNT_Pp4x4?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>)\n\n# References\n\n",
